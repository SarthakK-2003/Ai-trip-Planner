You'll need to replace these with actual URLs for images.  You can find these on hotel booking sites (like Booking.com, Expedia, etc.) and travel websites (like TripAdvisor, Yelp, etc.).\n*   **Pricing:** Prices are *estimates* and can fluctuate wildly depending on the time of year, day of the week, and any ongoing promotions.  Always check current prices before booking.\n*   **Deals:** Las Vegas is very deal-driven.  Look for hotel packages, show discounts, and happy hour specials.  Websites like Groupon, Travelzoo, and Vegas.com often have deals.\n*   **Transportation:** The Deuce bus is a good option for getting around, but it can be slow during peak times. Rideshares (Uber/Lyft) are convenient but more expensive.\n*   **Walking:** Be prepared to do a lot of walking! The Strip is much longer than it looks.\n*   **Flexibility:** This is a suggested itinerary.  Feel free to adjust it based on your interests and budget.\n*   **Booking:** Book hotels and any shows you want to see in advance, especially if traveling during peak season.\n*   **Tipping:** Remember to factor in tips for service staff (restaurants, bars, taxis, etc.).\n*   **Hydration:** Las Vegas is in the desert. Drink plenty of water!\n*   **Safety:** Be aware of your surroundings, especially at night.\n*   **Hotel Fees:** Be aware of resort fees, which can add significantly to the cost of your hotel. These are typically charged per night and cover amenities like Wi-Fi and access to the pool. Some hotels on Fremont Street also charge resort fees.\n\n**How to Use This JSON:**\n\n1.  **Copy the JSON text.**\n2.  **Paste it into a JSON viewer/editor:** There are many free online JSON viewers/editors (e.g., JSONLint, JSONFormatter). These will format the JSON to make it easier to read.\n3.  **Customize:**  Replace the placeholder URLs, adjust the dates, and modify the itinerary to fit your preferences.\n4.  **Use it to book and plan:** Use the information to book your hotel, research transportation options, and plan your daily activities.\n\nThis detailed plan should give you a great starting point for a fun and affordable Las Vegas trip!  Remember to do your own research and book in advance to get the best deals. Good luck!\n"},
